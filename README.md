## About This Repository

This repository documents my journey to **truly understand JavaScript** — not just memorize syntax, but grasp the fundamental mechanics behind every line of code.

**What you'll find here:**
- Deep explanations of how JavaScript actually works under the hood
- Practical programs demonstrating real-world applications
- Step-by-step examples you can run and modify
- Visual breakdowns of complex concepts
- Notes written in clear, accessible language

## Learning Path

JavaScript concepts build upon each other. Here's the recommended learning order:

| Step | Topic | What You'll Learn |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Execution Context** | How JavaScript processes your code |
| 2 | **Hoisting** | Why you can use variables before declaring them |
| 3 | **Memory Creation** | What happens before your code runs |
| 4 | **Temporal Dead Zone** | The "no-access" period for variables |
| 5 | **Block Scoping** | How `let` and `const` create boundaries |
| 6 | **Lexical Environment** | Where variables are accessible |
| 7 | **Closures** | Functions remembering their birthplace |
| 8 | **Function Invocation** | How functions are called and executed |
| 9 | **The `this` Keyword** | Understanding context binding |
| 10 | **Practical Applications** | Putting it all together |
